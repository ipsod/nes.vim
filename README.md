a Vim colorscheme inspired by the original 8-bit NES hardware
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a vim colorscheme that I've developed over the years.  I finally feel like I've got the
colors almost just right, but the code needs an overhaul, as it has some quirks:
- For some reason, it doesn't work in the terminal without explicitly loading it after vim is
  running.
- I've got no idea if it works with neovim.
- I've only tested it with languages and language-features that I actually use.
- There are images in the source so that I can embed them in this README.  I'm sure that there's a
  better way to do that.

Someday, I'd like to take some other colorscheme that does work well in terminal and neovim (like
kalisi -  https://github.com/freeo/vim-kalisi), and import these colors into it.  I don't know when
or if I'll get around to it, so a pull request would really be appreciated.
