This is a vim colorscheme I've developed over the years.  I've named it NES, because it reminds me
of the original NES's colorscheme.

I like the way it looks, but it has quirks:
- For some reason, it doesn't work in the terminal without explicitly loading it after vim is
  running.
- I've got no idea if it works with neovim.
- I've only tested it with languages and language-features that I actually use.
- There are images in the source so that I can reference here.  I'm sure that there's a better way
  to do that.

Someday, I'd like to take some other colorscheme that does work well in terminal and neovim (like
kalisi -  https://github.com/freeo/vim-kalisi), and import these colors into it.  I don't know when
or if I'll get around to it, so a pull request would really be appreciated.
